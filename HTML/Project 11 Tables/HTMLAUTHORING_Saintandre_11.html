<!-- Submit This: Companies
Create an HTML5 document from scratch that is correctly formed and coded that displays a table of several companies from around the world. There should be a field for the company name, the company’s country of origin, the date that it was started in and the names of its founders.

Use row colors to make the table’s content easier to read and add a single line border. Also, change the default font of the table into a font of your choosing. -->
