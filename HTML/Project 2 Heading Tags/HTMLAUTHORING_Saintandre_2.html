    <h1>With Rue My Heart is Laden</h1>

    <p><h3>For golden friends I had,</br>
    For many a rose-lipt maiden</br>
    And many a lightfoot lad.</br>
    By brooks too broad for leaping</br>
    The lightfoot boys are laid;</br>
    The rose-lipt girls are sleeping</br>
    In fields where roses fade.</h3></p>
