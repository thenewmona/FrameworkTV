            <p>A recent survey from data-tracking company <strong>Ensighten</strong> found that 46% <br>
                of all enterprise brands are concerned about data breaches after
                other large  <br>
                 such as <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Uber</strong>, were hacked.
                Still, 67% have no marketing security <br>
                in place, the survey found.

            </p>The <strong>Enterprise Ethereum Alliance</strong> and <strong>Hyperledger</strong> will combine forces
            to create an <br>
            <em>open-source</em>, standards-based cross-platform project to
            bring businesses distributed ledger solutions. <blockquote>"At <strong>Hyperledger</strong>, we're
                    very focused at building communities that build a set of software products <br>
                    and many of those touch on and implement Ethereum-related
                    standards, and the EEA is focused on <br>
                    driving a community of organizations around a common set of standards and then certifying
                    applications <br>
                    against those standards,"</blockquote> says <strong>EEA</strong> <em>Executive
                            Director Resnick </em> .</p>

            <p>How industry experts believe <em>AI</em> will affect the workforce
                Artificial intelligence is expected to significantly affect <br>
                the workforce in many sectors, with a 190% increase in the number of
                <strong>LinkedIn</strong> profiles listing <em>AI</em> skills on their <br>
                account profiles since 2015, according to <strong>LinkedIn</strong> data. The majority of experts say <em>AI</em> will
                help make teams more <br>
                 effective and make better decisions, a study  from <strong>Tata Communications</strong> found.</p>
